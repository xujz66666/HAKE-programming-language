# HAKE Programming Language
## 🌟 Project Background

I'm a GitHub beginner and programming novice with basic knowledge of Python, C, and Java. My C skills are limited, mostly to conditional statements. I created this project out of curiosity, but more importantly because I want a new programming language that combines the speed of C with the simplicity of Python. However, since I don't have strong programming skills, I've shared it on GitHub. This project started empty, and I need many developers to help build it while I manage the overall direction. This is exactly what I want - many developers contributing while I guide the project's vision!

## 📟 Development Requirements

Based on my research, here are the specifications:

Development Language: C (for speed)

Compiler Version: GCC 9.0+

Requirements: Easy to learn, fast execution. First, establish a solid foundation before deciding on development direction

Editors: VS2022, CLion, or VSCode

Operating System: Windows (start with solid basics, then expand to Linux/macOS)

## 📁 Project Structure

Based on Python and C structures (I'm not very familiar with this - waiting for the first developer's suggestions)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thank you to all developers contributing to the HAKE project! Special thanks to the C language community for providing abundant resources.

Let's build a concise and efficient programming language with C together! 🚀

If this project is helpful to you, please give us a ⭐️!
